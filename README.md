Digital Watermarking is the process that embeds data called a watermark, tag or label into a multimedia object such that watermark can be detected or extracted to make an assertion about the object may an image or video or audio may also be text only. 

A watermark can be perceived as an attribute of the carrier (cover). It may contain information such as copyright, license, tracking and authorship etc. whereas in case of steganography, the embedded message may have nothing to do with the cover.

In the project, in order to embed the watermark in the host image we are required to use the following two processes
namely, Discrete Cosine Transform and Genetic Algorithm.

The host image is taken as a gray scale image and watermark is a binary image. Initially, the host image is divided into blocks of 4 X 4 pixels. The single watermark bit is then embedded in a single block selected. Then the blocks are chosen using Genetic Algorithm.

The proposed method showed that the image remains imperceptible (because PSNR&gt; 40 dB) while the watermark have survived from attacks. The present application optimizes a set of blocks on the basis of Normalized Correlation.
